Frankenstein Portfolio
## Introduction
Hi, my name is Le Hoang Thinh, I identify myself as an inventor and I want to learn absolutely everything even if it is not practical.
<br>
This project is a my porfolio with the involvement of frontend, backend, database, devops, and many other domains.
Just as the name suggest, it is a Frankenstein porfolio, an abomination if you could say. 
But then again, the main purpose of this repo is for me to learn everything so expect the chaotics
